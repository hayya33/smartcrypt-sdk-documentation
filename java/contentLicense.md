## Attribution

Proper attribution is required when you reuse or create modified versions of content that appears on a page made

applies only to the non-documentation content, as described earlier in this document.

In practice we ask that you provide attribution to the Android Open Source project to the best of the ability of the
medium in which you are producing the work. There are several typical ways in which this might apply:

### Exact Reproductions

If your online work exactly reproduces text or images from this site, in whole or in part, please include a paragraph
at the bottom of your page that reads:

Portions of this page are reproduced from work created and shared by PKWARE, Inc. and used according to terms described
in the Creative Commons 4.0 Attribution License.

Also, please link back to the original source page so that readers can refer there for more information.

### Modified Versions

If your online work shows modified text or images based on the content from this site, please include a paragraph at
the bottom of your page that reads:

Portions of this page are modifications based on work created and shared by PKWARE, Inc. and used according to terms
described in the Creative Commons 4.0 Attribution License.

Again, please link back to the original source page so that readers can refer there for more information. This is even
more important when the content has been modified.

### Other Media

If you produce non-hypertext works, such as books, audio, or video, we ask that you make a best effort to include a
spoken or written attribution in the spirit of the messages above.
